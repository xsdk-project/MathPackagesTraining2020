  synopsis: >
    In this lecture we discuss the role and impact of high order, adaptive, and
    flexible time integration libraries in solution accuracy and computational
    efficiency of large-scale simulations.  Due to the wide variety of
    backgrounds among ATPESC participants, we briefly discuss
    * the location of time integrators in the HPC landscape, and their reliance on scalable nonlinear and linear solver libraries,
    * the different categories of time integration methods (explicit/implicit/IMEX),
    * the basic theoretical properties of time integration methods (order of accuracy, linear stability),
    * the role of temporal adaptivity for improving accuracy and efficiency,
    * an overview of DOE time integration packages.
    We spend approximately half of the time period in lecture, followed by
    hands-on exercises that examine stability, accuracy, temporal adaptivity,
    and the role of problem-specific preconditioning.  All of the hands-on
    exercises focus on time-dependent PDEs, and use the SUNDIALS' ARKODE
    library for time integration, along with the AMReX library for spatial
    semi-discretization.
