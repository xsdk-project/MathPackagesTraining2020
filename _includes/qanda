*
*   This include lets you easily create a click-able question and answer
*
*   You can even use markdown and <html>-tags inside a QandA but beware to use " and ' properly; for example:
*
*       {% include qanda question='Some Question' answer='Some Answer' %}
*
*   Notes:
*
*     1. We are using an in-line style to set the expanded box height here based on the amount of text
*        in the answer. It would be best to know number of lines needed. But, we need to know the font height
*        at gen-time and I didn't know how to get that easily.
*     2. It would be easier to use the at_least liquid filter instead of the if then else to style the size
*        of the box here but that is apparently buggy.
*     3. We allow for a maximum of 40 questions in a lesson. That is set by the max variable in the for loop
*        in _sass/_expandable.scss
*     4. the qanda_id gets used on a per-page basis. So, the number is always starting from unusued/initial
*        value of 0 and incrimenting by one.
