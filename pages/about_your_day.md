#### Hands On Exercises
* Lectures and brief hands-on exercises will be interleaved throughout the day.
Deeper dive hands-on lessons will be in the evening.
* Day-time hands-on will be brief runs of examples and exposure to key concepts
following fairly structured lesson plans.
* Evening hands-on will permit deeper dive into hands-on exercises of your choosing
and with less structured lessons.

#### Fun and Prizes!
We have some fun prizes to give away at the end of the evening! The hands on exercises
offer **optional** question and answer forms with the chance to gain points towards fun
prizes at the end of the evening. **These are optional** and intended to be for fun.
You are not **required** to participate but we highly recommend it for a few reasons.
First, its designed to be fun. Second, it helps us guage whether or not our training
materials are really having the intended impact.

* We have tried to design most of the hands-on lessons (day-time or evening) with
questions for which you will submit Google Forms for your answers.
* During day-time hands-on exercises, the expandable question-and-answer boxes
inline with the lesson (which ordinarily show the correct answers) will be disabled
but will provide a link to an associated Google From for you to submit your answers.
* During most of the evening hands-on exercises, you will submit a
[Show-Your-Work](https://goo.gl/forms/B7UFpBvEOJbC58oJ2) Google form by going to
the main menu (upper left of the site) Intro->Submit A Show Your Work. Be sure to
include any relevant code snipits, images, and written description and analysis
of your work.

#### Red Post-Its
For day-time hands-on exercises, you will be given a red sticky note to use if you encounter
issues running hands on lessons. Instead of raising hands and interrupting the day-time lesson,
we ask that you please place a red sticky note on the edge of your laptop display. Members
of the numerical software team will be watching and roaming the room looking for anyone that
has such notes _flying_ and will provide assistance. We ask that you please wait for a member
of the numerical software team to see it and come to help. If you correct the problem yourself
before you have been helped, remove the red note and set it aside until you need it again.
This protocol is necessary only during the day-time hands-on.

If you are running a Windows laptop or Chromebook, please be prepared to pair
with someone on OSX or Linux sitting near you or just follow the pre-tested lesson content.

#### Subject Matter Expert One-on-Ones
We are providing a [sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO1Yqwox6cbo0frQ9tJZMAWW8O8OLfhZm6ztbbC5gBI2Wn0g/viewform?usp=sf_link)
to arrange up to three, 20 minute two-on-one discussions with subject matter experts (SMEs)
in the evening which you can also find under the Intro menu. If you are interested,
please sign up by 4 pm CT (end of the afternoon break). After dinner, we will provide a
schedule for evening two-on-ones.  This is a great opportunity to discuss detailed issues
with experts in the field. You will, of course, have to decide how best to balance any
two-on-one discussions with your evening hands-on exercise activities as these activities
will both occur concurrently.

#### For Evening, Consider Working in Teams (2-4)
For the evening hands-on exercises, we encourage participants to work in teams of 2-4.
First, this helps us to cut down the number of IT issues that may arise during hands-on
exercises.  Moreover, [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)
(the practice of having two people work together
on one machine, each taking turns between typing and commenting) results in real-time
code review, which [research has shown](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584909000123)
results in higher productivity. Finally, if you are not using an OSX or Linux laptop, it would
be best to try to pair with someone who is.

#### Todays Agenda
The [agenda for today's presentations and hands-on exercises](atpesc_2019_agenda.md)
is available under the _Intro_ menu on this site. This includes links to presentation slides,
presenter information and hands-on lesson plans.

#### Chat Option
We will set up a Google Hangouts Chat starting the morning of the session. Expect to receive
an email invite with the subject _ATPESC2019 Numerical Packages Chat_. We will also include
a link under the Intro menu. We ask that you please exercise discretion and use this chat only
for interactions as they pertain to todayâ€™s material and exercises.

#### Getting Help
* If during day-time hands-on exercises, please use your red post-it note (see above)
* Feel free to flag any of us down throughout the day.
* Feel free to send email to
